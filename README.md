## Introduction
This repository of notebooks is for the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) [Introduction to Atmospheric Radar Course](https://ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/introduction-to-atmospheric-radar/) held between 10 and 14 June 2024 in Winchester. They provide an introduction to using open-source software, particularly Py-ART (https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart), for the visualisation and analysis of radar data.

The course aims to to support the use of radar-derived data by researchers.

The course will be based at the University of Winchester with a day spent at Chilbolton Atmospheric Observatory, Hampshire viewing the radars onsite.

## Practical Structure
This repository contains notebooks for the practical exercises.

They cover:
1. Basic introduction to open-source radar data structures and reading radar files.
2. Plotting data using open-source packages.
3. More advanced plotting of data.
4. Processing radar data using open-source packages inlcuding non-meteorological echo removal, attenuation correction and quantitative precipitation estimation.
5. Processing data from radar wind profilers.
6. Gridding radar data.

## List of course instructors
The course is organised by NCAS. The course leads are:
- Lindsay Bennett
- David Dufton

The course will also be delivered by:
- David Hooper
- Emily Norton
- Ryan Neely
- Sarah Barr

## Reproducability

The course will delivered using a cloud server running a open-source python software stack. To reproduce the code environment used for the course you can use the yaml file found in the repository. Data used in the course is all open data produced by NCAS. It can all be downloaded from the [Centre for Environmental Data Analysis archive](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk/) or you can contact the course organisers for more details.

## Open Radar Science

The course stands on the shoulders of a long standing effort in the radar community towards open science. We'd encourage all participants of the course, and anyone else who may be interested, to join the [open radar community discourse](https://openradar.discourse.group/) and get involved with the wider radar community.
